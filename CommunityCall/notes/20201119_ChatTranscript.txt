Can you use a light theme for the call? This is hard to read.

Is this work directly with the extension or within the PowerShellEditorServices?

Shawn Melton
Or bit of both?(Shawn Melton asked "Is this work directly with the extension or within the PowerShellEditorServices?")

Thanks Joey for the detailed update on WGs :-)

Michael Lombardi
Latest version of powershellget v3 on the gallery broke the DSC implementation fwiw

Michael Lombardi
I haven't had a chance to file issues yet(Michael Lombardi asked "Latest version of powershellget v3 on the gallery broke the DSC implementation fwiw")

Michael Lombardi
Mismatch between mof schema and parameters in Set-TargetResource - I'll file the bug or just submit a PR later today(Michael Lombardi asked "Latest version of powershellget v3 on the gallery broke the DSC implementation fwiw")

Robin
Is someone going to tweet the link to the Community Call minutes? I don't think enough people know about this and it would be something that would probably be featured on the powershell.org ICYMI post

Keith Hill
Then maybe the ?. should not be added to the language because folks that don't use ? in variable names will get tripped up on this as it won't be a syntax error.  It just won't behave as they expect at runtime $foo?.length -  here $foo? would be null and $null.length just return 0.  This has potential to introduce lots of bugs because every other language does not require {},

Michael Lombardi
Do you have defined criteria for how you assess compat breaks as risks?

Michael Lombardi
I'm deeply sympathetic to the need to handle breaking changes ofc as a language/tool vendor maintainer myself, just seeking clarity ≡ƒÆ£(Michael Lombardi asked "Do you have defined criteria for how you assess compat breaks as risks?")

Rob Holt
Absolutely and it's a really great question. In fact there was a Q&A session earlier in the week with Guido van Rossum and he spoke about this problem and the inevitable turn toward being conservative as a language evolves(Michael Lombardi asked "Do you have defined criteria for how you assess compat breaks as risks?")

Michael Lombardi
Yeah, it's also tough if you can't get the culture of your users on board with treating major versions with care - I've had customers auto-update / pin to master and then yell when it hurts, but it's a slow education process etc ime(Michael Lombardi asked "Do you have defined criteria for how you assess compat breaks as risks?")

Any ETA on PowerShellGet v3 handling authenticated repositories in a user friendly manner or supporting v3 repositories?

Staged approach? Warn on usage of ? in variables in one release and disable later

I just did some PHP work and the code was broken on almost every minor revision. I feel like you are the extreme to the other side and the best balance is somewhere in the middle

Keith Hill
FWIW I super appreciate the level of backwards compatibility that has been maintained (and we've enjoyed) since v1!

Update-Help shouldn't update help in 5.1

then you wouldn't have that PSReadLine issue

example for can't have latest help for a cmdlet in both Win PS and PS core, Get-Serice do have a ComputerName parameter in win PS but not in PS core

Justin Grote
Definitely the PM presence has been felt, great job to the team.

If you say PS7 can run side-by-side PS5.1 without interference, and then you update help in 5.1 from PS7, that's not really true 

Chris Warwick
Thanks for the call :-)
