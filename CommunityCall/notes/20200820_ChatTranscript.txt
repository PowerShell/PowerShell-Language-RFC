It's barely noticable. The PowerShell extension already parses the file you're looking at so there's really no extra logic beyond a simple map method :)(Michael B asked "What is the speed impact of semantic highlighting?")

Open the command pallet.
type "tokens"
click "inspect editor tokens and scopes"(Like the syntax highlighting! What was the poppup showing the tokenization in VSCode?)

then you can click around the file to see the tokens (both TextMate and Semantic). This is _very_ useful for writing your own themes!(Like the syntax highlighting! What was the poppup showing the tokenization in VSCode?)

Would there be a way to set a file to default into Notebook mode for sharing?

Notebook Mode will get more stable as the vscode APIs become more stable :)

I think notebook mode will provide a much lower barrier to entry for those interested in the notebook concept.

I can't find an issue for that one, so please open an issue in the PowerShell repo: https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/new/choose(Mick Pletcher asked "One thing that would be REALLY nice is if cleanmgr.exe could be successfully controlled via PowerShell")
