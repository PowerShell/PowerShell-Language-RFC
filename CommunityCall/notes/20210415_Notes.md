# PowerShell Community Call - April 15, 2021

## Agenda

* Rob/Danny to cover PSArm preview 1
* Sydney/Amber on PowerShellGet v3 update and PowerShellGallery outage
* Steve on 7.2, MU, and minimal PowerShell update
* Dongbo on `Clean` block update
* Jim on native command passing change
* Community Demos
* Q&A (https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell-RFC/issues/282)

## Notes

* PSArm preview 1, released March 31st 2021--many similarities and shared infra with Bicep
* Approach is to create a PowerShell specific experience
* Check out the GitHub repo (https://github.com/PowerShell/PSArm) for more information
* PowerShellGet v3—making progress to have a release later this month or early next month, this
  release will be complete in terms of the cmdlet interface (but not necessarily feature-complete
  but hopefully fairly close)
* Planning to start accepting community contributons in May
* PowerShell Gallery had an outage on March 22nd due to a certificate issue
* We have a few repair items to further automate this process to avoid this issue in the future
* PowerShell 7.2 continuing with monthly preview releases
* Currently having a discussion is happening on 7.2 preview releases
  https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/discussions/15236
* Currently exploring pulling out parts of SMA to create a smaller PowerShell version
* This journey will go beyond 7.2 timeframe (maybe 7.4)
* Dongbo will be working on driving the `Clean` block update in the 7.2 timeframe, PR is currently
  open and feedback is welcome
* Original PR for the 'CleanUp' PR: Implement Cleanup { } Function Block by vexx32 · Pull Request
  #9900 · PowerShell/PowerShell (https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/pull/9900)
* The draft PR for the alternative implementation: [WIP] Clean block prototype with error handling
  by daxian-dbw · Pull Request #15177 · PowerShell/PowerShell
  (https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/pull/15177)
* Target for completion is May release (as an experimental feature), if not it will ship in June
* We have created a new experimental feature `PSNativeCommandArgumentPassing`begining in 7.2
  preview5
* We would love feedback on this new experimental feature
* Justin Grote provided a demo of "Press" a tool he is working on for Module CI
