* SecretManagement and SecretStore previews
* PowerShellGallery update
* VSCode extension stability
* Working Groups
* TBD

## Notes

* PowerShell 7.1 GA went out last week
  * community-oriented release focused on smaller feature enhancements and bug fixes
  * first GA release of PowerShell available on the Microsoft Store
    * side-by-side with the preview version
  * Thank you to our contributors and testers!
* PowerShell 7.2 preview went out yesterday!
  * includes a lot of the contributions that couldn't go into 7.1 because of RCs
  * will be working on features for the first half of 2020,
    working to refine and make decisions on whether to ship these features in the
    second half of 2021
  * our goal is to have a preview drop available very quickly after GA so that
    folks using previews don't get left behind on an old pre-GA RC
  * will be on .NET 5 until .NET 6 previews start in 2021
  * plan to have a blog post in early 2021 to detail planned features and
    initiatives for PowerShell 7.2
  * TBD whether the a preview 2 will ship in December of 2020
* plan to move from `master` to `main`, but we're currently waiting on tooling
  to help make that transition as painless as possible
* updateable help pipeline
  * many of the cmdlet reference and about_* topics in documentation have been
    kept up to date on the web, but updates are not being pulled down via `Update-Help`
  * `Update-Help` now works for 7.0, 7.1, and 7.2
  * working with individual teams like SCCM, Windows, and Office to onboard them
    to a new `Update-Help` pipeline so that more cmdlet reference updates make
    it down to your machine's console
  * `Update-Help -Force` is required because of quirks today in our versioning
    * we're working on it
  * one outstanding issue case sensitivity with `PSReadLine`
    * learn more [here](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/powershell/updating-help-for-the-psreadline-module/)
* SecretManagement and SecretStore
  * released preview 6 and preview 4, respectively, this week
  * focus on improving compatibility with Windows PowerShell 5.1
  * also included UX improvements, especially around vault registration
  * we love seeing folks on Twitter and GitHub teaming up to build extension vaults
  * when is the Azure KeyVault extension being updated?
    * no exact ETA, but we just spoke with them this week, and it should be relatively soon
  * when will SecretManagement and SecretStore release as GA/supported?
    * hopefully soon, we're still working through some compliance tasks
* PowerShellGallery updates
  * significant outage on Oct 29-30
  * root cause back to many of the stats issues we've been seeing for the previous few weeks
    * too many downloads!
  * as we made updates to stats issues, Gallery CPU usage spiked and made it unavailable
  * we learned a ton overall from the outage
  * silver lining: a ton of users and services depend on the PowerShell Gallery,
    and we'll be investing significantly in the stability and reliability of the Gallery
* VS Code extension stability
  * the difficulty comes with the fact that we're forced to use one session
    (more specifically, one thread), and only got worse with the introduction of PSReadLine
    in the Integrated Console
  * stability issues weren't clearly reproducible, were often very specific to particular environments
  * we've now identified a primary problem, and Rob has been working on re-implementing the way
    that PowerShell manages itself within the extension
  * this means that everything around remoting, debugging, and more has to be 'rewired'
  * the fix is essentially all-or-nothing, which is why you haven't seen incremental improvements
    as this has been re-implemented over the last few months
  * goal is to get out a preview by the end of the year
    upon which you'll see a significant improvement
  * not promising *perfection*, but it will be much easier to continue improving over time
  * virtually all the work is actually in PowerShell Editor Services (PSES),
    which mean that any other extensions or tools using PSES will benefit from the fix
    * still good to file issues in `PowerShell/vscode-powershell` so that customers and users
      have visibility into shared problems
* Working Groups
  * `WG-*` labels have shown up, and many were renamed straight from the `Area-*` labels
  * Working Group members will be expected to participate some minimum bar of issues and pull requests
    * probably totaling ~1-2+ hours per week
  * apologies for the delay, expect a blog post soon, as well as updates to `docs/maintainers` and
    `docs/community` in the `PowerShell/PowerShell` repo
* PowerShellGet 3.0
  * Some of the Gallery issues have delayed progress on PowerShellGet 3.0
  * hoping to get another preview out this calendar year
  * GA release will be quality-driven rather than date-driven
  * goal is to get PowerShellGet into a 7.2 preview ASAP
* [requirement for braces around variable for null-conditional operator](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/14025)
  * Committee decision not to make any changes today, but we can continue to talk about it
  * Still really dependent on the extent to which folks are using `?` in variable names
* [Implementing cleanup/dispose block](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/pull/9900)
  * We really would like to get this into 7.2, will be working with @vexx32 on this over the next few months
* Intended theme of 7.1 was to improve native EXE/binary shell experience,
  but we kicked the can on many of these issues to 7.2
  * will have to have harder conversation around breaking changes,
    which are essentially required to make any improvements in this space
  * e.g. [call native operator](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/13068)
    or [escaping of certain characters](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/1995)
* criteria for breaking changes
  * doc published [here](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/dev-process/breaking-change-contract.md)
    for categorization of breaking changes
  * we tend to think along the axes of the severity of the break, prevalence of the break,
    and the ease of fixing the break once you've been broken
  * benefits of the break
  * e.g. it's difficult to paper over syntax errors because you're required to have separate scripts
    with a script that switches based on which version you're using
  * this is why new operators e.g. are difficult to implement in a mixed version ecosystem
* `Update-Help` in 7.x updates Windows PS modules in your `PSModulePath` as well
  * Should still download proper help
