 I thought this meeting was going to be a regular Teams call instead of a live event.

When will that be changed?

joshcorr
We can hear you!

I had to drop the call and re-join before I was able to get in

Darwin
I added an item to the GH issue

Any idea when Download center would happen? It would be great for those of us that have github as a dns blackhole.

Joey Aiello
 No ETA right now, unfortunately. There's a lot of backend and internal work to get there. But we totally understand the scenario, that's a big reason for us wanting to do this(Nathan M  asked "Any idea when Download center would happen?

Thank you for the public MS stance on PS within Windows. Is it possible to make a similar statement about VSC? As ISE doesn't currently support PS 6+.

Any chance of getting a -Metadata on Get-Secret or Remove-Secret?

Steve Lee (POWERSHELL)
 Please open an issue!(joshcorr  asked "Any chance of getting a -Metadata on Get-Secret or Remove-Secret? ")

Justin Grote
 The metadata is there by default with Get-Secret if it is present. (joshcorr  asked "Any chance of getting a -Metadata on Get-Secret or Remove-Secret? ")

Justin Grote
 Also to be clear, I mean Get-SecretInfo, not get-Secret. Get-Secret is only meant to return the credential directly, so metadata there doesn't make sense.(joshcorr  asked "Any chance of getting a -Metadata on Get-Secret or Remove-Secret? ")

Justin Grote
 Both my Keepass and Chromium vaults have metadata support now, should do a new release early next week.(joshcorr  asked "Any chance of getting a -Metadata on Get-Secret or Remove-Secret? ")

For Dynamic Help are there options in the pager to add custom keybinds like vim?

 Sorry meant as a parameter.  I will post in an issue. Purpose would be if a vault supports multiple versions of a secret you can provide the version you want (joshcorr  asked "Any chance of getting a -Metadata on Get-Secret or Remove-Secret? ")

 Probably won't be a GA thing but Get-SecretInfo has a -Filter parameter that is meant to be implemented however the vault extension author wants. I've been considering using Keywork Query Language (Google-Style) syntax to select by metadata. You can also use the pipeline and Where-Object to filter secrets by the metadata.(joshcorr  asked "Any chance of getting a -Metadata on Get-Secret or Remove-Secret? ")

What VSCode bracketed section colouriser extension is Justin using?

Anonymous
Do you use the chocolatey nano package?

Mike O'Neill
bounceCode Awesome! I need that from time to time.

Mike O'Neill
Bracket pair colorizer and indent-rainbow

 My streaming keeps freezing, is there a good way to watch this again after the fact?

 Sorry about that, Nathan. There will be a YouTube recording published on our YT channel(Nathan M  asked "My streaming keeps freezing, is there a good way to watch this again after the fact?")

Not on container hosts that run server core on the cloud eh?

Or cloud shell.

One liner for getting Nano: If (!(Test-Path env:chocolateyinstall)) {iwr https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1 -UseBasicParsing | iex} ; cinst -y fscapture

See the GitHub issue re PowerShell Core now being autopackaged

Darwin
Also functions as a template for autopackaging on GitLab with GitLab runner :) https://gitlab.com/guided-explorations/microsoft/chocolatey/powershell-core

Question will it cause heartburn for anyone to have powershell-preview package remerged to powershell-core on chocolatey?

Dave Richardson
 old question, maybe, is import-module still a viable way to install in house modules. or should I switch to using psrepos?

Sean Wheeler
 Stable release: https://aka.ms/powershell-release?tag=stable
Preview release: https://aka.ms/powershell-release?tag=preview
LTS release: https://aka.ms/powershell-release?tag=lts

Justin Grote
 Import-Module doesn't really "install" modules, it "loads" them, did oyu mean install-module? If so then yes you can add pretty much any file share as a powershell repository(Dave Richardson  asked "old question, maybe, is import-module still a viable way to install in house modules. or should I switch to using psrepos?")

Justin Grote
 Here's a good article on the subject: https://4sysops.com/archives/how-to-create-a-file-share-powershell-repository/(Dave Richardson  asked "old question, maybe, is import-module still a viable way to install in house modules. or should I switch to using psrepos?")

Dave Richardson
 Yes, should I start using Install-modules?(Dave Richardson  asked "old question, maybe, is import-module still a viable way to install in house modules. or should I switch to using psrepos?")

Dave Richardson
 Thanks(Dave Richardson  asked "old question, maybe, is import-module still a viable way to install in house modules. or should I switch to using psrepos?")

Dave Richardson
 We were copying them into the Windows  powershell modules folder, and on a new server we are not seeing them load, when copied(Dave Richardson  asked "old question, maybe, is import-module still a viable way to install in house modules. or should I switch to using psrepos?")

Joel Sallow
 I don't think there should be an issue provided the powershell-preview package is listed with the prerelease version numbers, since choco will not auto-update to a preview version unless asked

Darwin
previews are hidden on Chocolatey - hence why I put it on a seperate Id - so they won't be hidden on the site

kvprasoon
Thank you all :-)
