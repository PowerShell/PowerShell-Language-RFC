Hello everyone

Adil
Greetings Mortals.

Jon J.
Mornin'

Adil
whoa hold up your browser setup is rad

Adil
for systems that weve set to install and update via Microsoft Store.... would the MS store also handle the Net 6 installation as dependancy?

Mike Kanakos
we added the community details to the powershell.org community calendar

Ryan Yates
How does this end up showing in transcripts?

Keith Hill
In Windows Terminal, while the progress bar is rendering, I see a flashing cursor at the beginning of the line which is distracting.   Any chance of perhaps hiding it until progress is complete?

Anonymous
Is there a dynamic width so it only takes up as much width as the message?

Anonymous
Is there a way to get the progress back back to the top of the page?

Don Hunt
Progress bar changes look good.

ili101
I was hoping this fixed https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/13005 but this is still happening with this new progress

Sean Kearney
So the new Write-Progress has additional parameters but retains old parameters?

Jon J.
Do modules have to be re-written to take advantage of the new progress bar format?

Steve Lee (POWERSHELL)
No, this is purely a visualization change and no changes to cmdlets/scripts writing progress(Jon J.  asked "Do modules have to be re-written to take advantage of the new progress bar format?")

Steve Lee (POWERSHELL)
No new parameters, this is purely a visualization change(Sean Kearney  asked "So the new Write-Progress has additional parameters but retains old parameters?")

Steve Lee (POWERSHELL)
That issue is independnet of changing how progress is visualized.  The problem there is to optimize wrting progress it's on a timer to not write that often so if it's too fast, it'll miss the timer.  Would love to see a community fix for this.(ili101  asked "I was hoping this fixed https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/13005 but this is still happening with this new progress")

Adil
Data parsing and creating PSCustomObject for creating Python Pandas like use cases are becoming moer and more

Is there a comparison of something like Performance of PS 5x vs PS 7x in parsing and creating PSCustomObjects (arrays of PSCustomObjects)?

And is there a resource that helps us write far more performant parsing code?

Looks like it's @PSCommunityBlog

Justin Grote

Mike Kanakos
are there guidelines on content that is relevant for the new blog? preferred topics , etc.

Sean Kearney
Facebook group has been updated as well

In this new blog format is there a way to have executable code blocks and a lite editor like VS Code Notebooks? This would let blog readers get real time feedback and experimentation.

Sean Wheeler
The new twitter handle is https://twitter.com/pscommunityblog

Jason Helmick
Yes, it needs to be powershell related example - we are avoiding product announcements (marketing). We will have clearer guidelines posted soon, but basically powershell solutions are welcome(Mike Kanakos  asked "are there guidelines on content that is relevant for the new blog? preferred topics , etc.")

Jason Helmick
Thanks Sean!!(Sean Kearney  asked "Facebook group has been updated as well")

Jason Helmick
it is! (sorry) @PSCommunityBlog(JB "AspenForester" Lewis  asked "Looks like it's @PSCommunityBlog")

Jason Helmick
Not at this time, but we will be taking community suggetions as Issues and will look into it.  Please file an issue! ;)(In this new blog format is there a way to have executable code blocks and a lite editor like VS Code Notebooks?

Jeremiah Strong
Why not move to a normal Teams Meeting? Like the old way with S4B meeting? Just curious

Joshcorr
Love the community demo idea durring this call. There are a lot of great modules out there.

Greg Wojan
Joey, I can hardly hear you all of the sudden.

Justin Grote [MVP]
I yield my time to Adam so he can do more detail if he wants :)

Corbob
Back in the day where Windowing systems were to allow you to load more terminals ðŸ˜‚

Ryan Yates
Not true anymore @Joey

Anonymous
You can open up to guests but you are limited to 250

Ryan Yates
They just need the link to the meeting(Ryan Yates  asked "Not true anymore @Joey")

Dongbo Wang
Calling a .NET method directly is faster than running a cmdlet.(Totally random off topic question (but trying my luck), is it generally more performant to use .Net ways of doing things in PowerShell? i.e. [Guid]::NewGuid() is quicker vs New-Guid etc.)

Dongbo Wang
But you usually don't need to worry about the perf difference between them(Totally random off topic question (but trying my luck), is it generally more performant to use .Net ways of doing things in PowerShell? i.e. [Guid]::NewGuid() is quicker vs New-Guid etc.)

Any update on PSGetv3?

Justin Grote [MVP]
Joey the RTPSUG does a pretty large normal teams meeting (50+) I would get with them to find how they manage it.

Adil
OH SHIT Powershell in WebAssembly

Great stuff ! Appreciate the feedback.(Totally random off topic question (but trying my luck), is it generally more performant to use .Net ways of doing things in PowerShell? i.e. [Guid]::NewGuid() is quicker vs New-Guid etc.)

How about the next rc release on Secretmanagement?

Anonymous
Would like to see PS Get v3 have support for NuGet (nuget.org) package dependencies at GA or as a first feature release

Mike Kanakos
love the secretmanagement module!
